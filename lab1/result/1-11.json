    "text": "TLDR: The new Commonwealth Bar charged a $5 cover on Sunday, when I have seen graveyards with more life.\n\nEDIT Address of bar/pub/club/lounge/bar-club hybrid or whatever it thinks it is (a plub? Clar? Lounbar? Barounge?) WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU? is, 731 10th Ave SW.\n\n Driving past that new Commonweath Bar that I have watched being built/refitted or what have you, a few days after it opened, I thought to myself, 'Hmm..I will stop and check it out inside, have a quiet pint before heading home.' (I live nearby).\n\nWalking along the window, I note the three, maximum four persons at the bar inside, some of them are possibly freinds of the owners.\n\nUndeterred, I walk in, past the nice coat check girl.\n\"Hello!\" she says, brightly.\n\n\"Oh, hello!\" I reply, stopping to pace a step or two back to about to ask her what beers she had.\n\n\"Five dollars please!\" she stated, surprising me.\n\n\"What for?\", I countered.\n\n\"Cover charge.\" - she blurted.\n\n\"Oh? Is there a live band playing or on?\" I asked, genuinely perplexed. I didn't catch her reaction as two male members of staff had sauntered over, perhaps to actually talk to a real live customer, instead of eachother all night. This was at 10:45pm on a Sunday. The joint was a graveyard, I could tell, there was no hubbub of voices trying to compete with the music, it had that empty, 'echoey' sound to it, as if one was playing a boom box in an empty room with hard walls. I asked them what beers, they had. Rolling Rock, apparently. Okay, a Bud-Anhauser Busch product, not a good start.\n\n\"Anything else? Anything European?\" I enquired.\n\n\"mmmmmmm\" Thought the taller man.\n\n\"Guinness?\" I prompted.\n\n\"Nope. But I think we have Newcastle Brown in cans.\", volunteered the shorter man.\n\n I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. (not because Newky Broon Ale is bad, it isn't - it's delicious at about 13c, but serving it on tap would be a hell of a better idea, if only put it in front of peoples eyes, and perhaps then bud drinkers to try and and therefore educate the plebes on a beer that tastes of, well, beer.)\n\n\"Is this place a bar or club?\" Seeing if I could find out what on earth charging $5 was actually for.\n\n\"A club.\" Replied the shorter man, positively.\n\n I thought a moment about appealing to their sense of ridiculousness by pointing out the evidence, that the sign, stated 'Bar' outside, and the last time I checked, bars, do not normally charge covers if nothing special is happening. I quickly thought better of it, as I didn't have the energy nor time to debate bar staff who were sperm when I was running pubs, on how a bar, has the gall to charge an entry fee, and why I should not. I parted ways with the 2 black polo uniformed barmen with a simple resigned, \"Nevermind.\", turned on my heel, and left.\n\nDear Commonwealth, here's some tips, from an experienced pub landlord, that has managed several pubs in the UK, from London, to Aberdeen, and a few cities in between.\n\nDon't charge customers money just to get into your pub/bar. Pubs in the UK and most of mainland Europe don't charge money to get in, and ours mostly do a roaring trade.\n\nWant to be different? Then don't stock the same old fizzy, stone cold, tasteless piss that counts for beer, that EVERYONE ELSE stocks. You know, the usual suspects, Molson, Coors lite, bud, Canadian, Keith's, kokanee etc. Try stocking beer, that oh, I don't know, actually tastes of something. Pilsner Urquell, London Pride, Marston's Pedigree for eg.\n\nEnough with the 'non gimmick' gimmicks. Maybe you are charging $5 to pay for the obscene cost to refit the bar in brand new sexy minamilist panelling everywhere, stuffed birds behind glass, and zeus knows what other props stuck behind a bar. How's this for a theme? Dark wood panels, cozy nooks, lower ceilings, soft furnishings to absorb echoes. Not everyone wants their bar to look like a branch of IKEA. Take a leaf from the JD Wetherspoon company in the UK. No music, TVs, Video games, just cheap good beer and food. They make money hand over fist.\n\nSorry Commonwealth, but your 'Uncommon Bar' is a similar to what most others are doing in Calgary. Same old beer, same old trying too hard theme, same old high prices. Yawn. Nothing to see here, next.\n\n**UPDATE** A month or so later around December time, in really bitter cold weather, my partner wanted to go by themselves, to 'give it another chance', and to join a couple of chums already inside. After my other half comes back home, they tell me that they were waiting outside in a queue, in -20c weather, the queue was about 20ft long, and the place was only 1/3 full inside. This was, I believe, quite early in the evening. I was incredulous, so I drove around a 10 min short trip to look. Sure enough, a queue, and looking inside, tables empty, and Id say 2/3 full now to be generous. Meanwhile people are freezing their asses off outside. Commonwealth, you better have a good excuse for this type of callous disregard for potential spending customers. Avoid!",

    "text": "Cliff's Notes on why I love this place:\n - open late (until 4AM on weekends)\n - cheap and great value - all the prices are set so it's round numbers after tax, so you don't walk around with change in your pockets like an asshole.\n - no extra charge for ingredients - Chipotle charges extra for guacamole. I was okay with this before I discovered Burrito Boyz. I used to love C.H.I.P.O.T.L.E.\n - haven't had a single dry bite due to careful burrito building\n - the burritoes are damned tasty - ingredients are fresh and they don't skimp on the pricey things\n - get the famous halibut if it's your first time here\n\nThe long version:\n\nThere's a lot of hype behind this place - my brother used to live in Toronto and mentioned Burrito Boyz as a spot that I *need* to go to. While tempting, I never had the opportunity. I mean, it's just a burrito joint, right? The Chipotle near my apartment serviced me well and Fat Bastard and Bandidos, while good, wasn't anything amazing.\n\nWell, I finally got to check this point out yesterday... and today. Yup - I ate here twice in less than 24 hours.\n\nWhile wandering the city on Nuit Blanche, we were close and hungry enough to try Burrito Boyz. Downstairs from a Smoke's and in the clubbing district, this is truly targetting the shit-faced crowd.\n\nComing here after midnight on a Saturday was a gong show. Long lineups and a huge crowd. All the yelling by the servers agitated me and I thought the system of ordering, paying, waiting a random amount of time, going back to the front to pick your toppings, and then waiting again for pick-up was painfully inefficient. Why not just ask for my toppings when I ordered?\n\nAfter a long wait, C. charges outside with our order and tells me to 'Feel this' and drops our two large $11 (tax in) halibut burritos in my hands.\n\nWhat the fuck! I nearly drop the burritos as I didn't expect to catch something that weighed the equivalent of a small child. This is great but I became concerned people love this place, not for the quality, but just for the portions.\n\nOur plan was to eat 1/2 of our burritos and stash the remaining for the rest of the night as we were about midway through our Nuit Blanche Death March. With the size of the thing, a portion is more than enough to sate us and nothing says 'classy' like \"Art + Half Eaten Burrito\".\n\nThe plan failed miserably as we just beasted the whole thing down. We seriously could not stop eating it. The halibut was delicious - unlike most burritos where you can't tell 1/2 the time what protein you picked, the ingredients were fresh and balanced. Eating it fresh, I could even taste the crunchy fish batter for first 1/3 of the burrito before all the other goopiness from the salsa, cream, guacamole. hot sauce and beans took over. Like a good Tex-Mex burrito, it was very rich, creamy satisfying, but you can actually taste the ingredients.\n\nNot sure if I was eating it wrong or the huge crowds resulted in a sloppy wrap job, but the burrito structure eventually collaped near the base and I had to ravenously half eat/half slurp the last 10% of the burrito. After ingesting this huge gut bomb, I uncontrollably let out a Rick Ross grunt. It was that good. It made the rest of my night difficult, walking around 8 km with a 4 lb burrito brick in my stomach wasn't a smart move, but I regret nothing.\n\nAfter a long night and waking up at 5PM famished since we didn't eat anything for the rest of the night, we decided to go watch a movie. Trying to tip toe around our collective shame, we agree that Burrito Boyz was 'on the way' and the only 'logical' choice for our 8PM breakfast/lunch/dinner.\n\nThe second visit was much more pleasurable. No lineup and the staff was far more relaxed and very friendly. I went for the large chicken breast & steak mix (no extra charge - $8 tax in) and C. got a small veggie soy ($6.75 tax in).\n\nIf I didn't have enough art this weekend, watching them carefully constructed my burrito tower was a bit of an art form. Both burritos were filled well and no 'dry' bites (sections with no meat). And this time, the burrito had much more structural integrity - so I ate 2/3 of the burrito and saved the rest for later. Nothing says 'boss' like eating a burrito the size of your forearm in a movie theater.\n\nThe beef/chicken burrito I had was also excellent and the steak was really tender and the chicken wasn't dry. Had a few bites of the veggie soy and it wasn't offensive (honestly, the best I can say for most veggie things).\n\nBurrito Boyz is probably the best Tex-Mex 'cheap/fast food' burrito joint I've been to. Yes, it's better than Chipotle. Yes, even better than when I went crazy in east Los Angeles. Being the best Tex-Mex in my book, basically makes this the best 'Mexican' place I've been to (admit it, 'bastardized' Tex-Mex is often better than 'authentic' Mexican - you're just too afraid to say it).",

    "text": "Bite was amazing as always. When I found out they were selling tickets I bought mine and my friends. $15 presale and $25 at the door. PRESALE BABY! We ended up coming around 1pm and just started walking around and eyeing the park and everything that was around. We started out by the Race Now tables and worked our way around. After our first go around our other friends showed up and we started to get into the food. \n\nFood \nPineapple park- My first stop on the bite road. I wanted the dole whip and I got it! I order the pineapple upside down cake and it was amazing, it reminded me of a shot i order when I first turned 21, not sure why I haven't ordered it since. \n\nTexas Twister- First drink stop, We though lemonade and you can refill, why not? And we were a little disappointed. It didn't taste sweet. It was more of a bland lemonade. Only plus was the fruit in the cup, my friends ate it all. \n\nPapa Johns- One of the last stops of the night. When you only have $3 left and you need something hot and homey, when papa was the way to go and it was close. Haha, super glad they handed out the garlic sauce. \n\nCulinary dropout- Not my first experience with Culinary drop out. They had the sames cheese and bread at the B&W party and it was still as delicious as ever. \n\nPanda Express and friends- When over because I saw sushi and was interested. My friends told me it was a bad idea but they were wrong. Probably my favorite meal of the day. They had spam musubi and some cream cheese wontons. They said for a dollar more I could get two egg rolls, so I told them to throw it in the bag. My friends of course stole some but that's why I got them. \n\nRainforest Cafe- Our favorite place to sit and eat. We happen to grab a small table after grabbing some food we needed to st down to eat. They kept the tables clean and they were fill. \n\nClaim Jumper- Two of my friends went here and order some sliders and chips, as well as a salad. I of course ate all their chips and a lot of the salad. It was a Cesar salad and it was pretty good. We dipped the chips in the cheese fondue form culinary and it was bomb.com. They also had a guy yelling about double chocolate cookie that were as big as his head.. Very tempting sir. \n\n\nVendors\nAfter stuffing ourselves with food we started walking the tents of free things and sign ups. The first stop was State Farm, who I already have insurance for but sign up to win a $250 ft card, I was down. Also they gave out shades, awesome. Next was Toyota. They had iPad to sign  up for stuff and they you spun a wheel for prizes. They had black shades, awesome. Also they had chap stick and hats. Next was KB homes. We literally just went there to get the free cotton candy. It almost blew away when the wind started but i saved it with my mouth. We walked our way the the Metro PCS booth and threw a phone in water to get more shade, purple, awesome. Then checked out the idea image booth. Orange shades, awesome. Then went over the the hospital booth, the had heart clip magnets, sunscreen, stress ball brains, and many different colored shade including pink, awesome. I got a lot of shades now, just saying. \n\nMusic\nMy real reason for going, because lets be honest a $15 is a steal. The line up included Daughtry, Colbie Caillat, O.A.R., American Authors, Lindsey Stirling and The Script. We really were just listening to the first couple bands and didn't actually sit and watch til Colbie. She was wearing shade which I though was funny but I love her song Try. During her set is when I had to get up and try and find a sweater. Her crew had shirt and some long sleeves but no hoodies or anything so we went on a mission to find something to warm me up. We failed. The military hoodies sold out and the race shop said they would get more in a hour. We ended up telling security we were grabbing a jacket and sat in the car til The Script came on. I thought they were so high energy and fun. At one point the lead singer asked for someone to call and ex boyfriend and he took the phone and sang and talked and kept calling back when he hung up. He also wanted to make a moment and ask for everyone to put down the camera and just turn on lighters or lights. I really liked that. He also came into the crowd which was really cool. \n\nRandom\nThe Vegas area was really nice and chill we ended up there multiple times to sit and relax. The best part was right before The Scrip came on they were giving away Tshirts, hats, cards, and dice for your car. The lady was really cool and was trying to make it fun by throwing it over her shoulder. The red couches were comfy and right my grass so you could take your shoes off. Other random was the bathrooms, i mean porta potty. When i went in the early day i grab some TP assume they would run out. I came back later and the potties still seem pretty clean and stock. Also love that they have the sinks to wash hands.",

    "text": "BBQ lovers, READ THIS.\n\nI'm writing to declare a new undisputed champion in Arizona barbecue.  I'm also here to declare that this place is BETTER than Salt Lick's in Texas and BETTER than Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City (and yes I have been to both).  And if you've been to Franklin Barbecue in Austin, this place will remind you A LOT of Aaron Franklin's location and his masterpieces.  I'm not joking, I'm not exaggerating, I mean it with every fiber of my being.  It truly is that amazing.\n\nI had read the Yelp reviews about this place and was stunned to see nothing but 5 star reviews from Yelpers.  Even though the place is fairly new, its not often that any establishment gets this many rave reviews this early.  When I saw their Facebook page, I noticed they were sending out notifications to their growing list of fans that they were selling out of their food within 3 hours everyday.  And it only seems to be selling out quicker.  Thats my queue to get here right at opening on a Saturday morning.\n\nThe location is as joint as a joint gets.  An old building, with an enormous smoker outside for everyone to see and smell.  They're using nothing but wood to smoke their meats (a mixture of hickory and oak woods).  They serve their meats market style by weight and also offer meat plates with sides.  They don't serve alcohol, but do offer a bunch of canned and bottled sodas and water.  When my Dad and I got here at opening on Saturday, the line out the door was already 15 deep.  Fortunately the line was moving at a decent clip so we only had to wait about 20 minutes to get our food.  Many of patrons we were in line with have already been here multiple times and swear by the place, so that upped our confidence level in this spot.\n\nWhen you walk inside the owners are carving meats and serving up sides right behind the counter.  Each of them are super friendly and super passionate about their meats.  They'll offer you samples if you want a taste of a meat you're not sure of.  The menu is written on cardboard right above the counter for all to see.  Since this our first time and we were hungry, we ordered a 1/2 pound of everything.  Brisket, turkey, sausage, pulled pork, ribs, and their Saturday special, beef ribs.  They piled on a half pound of each on a lunch tray with wax paper and serve it with white bread slices, pickles and onions.  Combined with a couple of waters, the total for all the food was $60.  Not cheap, but we ordered a ridiculous amount of meat (see my photo) and the owners say they pay extra to get the best meat.\n\nThey have a small amount of seating inside, but we decided to enjoy our lunch outside in their shaded picnic table area right next to the smoker.  They have misters to keep the shaded area cool during the warm days so its safe to be out there during the summer.  My Dad and I split all the meat we ordered.\n\nAlright, the verdict on the food.  First off the brisket.  If you've ever been to Franklin's in Austin (or have watched Anthony Bourdain's visit there), you know its ludicrously moist and tender.  My friend coined Franklin's brisket as being \"meat cream\".  I never thought I could find brisket even close to that good.  While this place might not be Franklin's, its as close as I've ever had.  Tender, smokey, juicy, cuts with a fork and melts in your mouth.  They put 13 hours of labor into that brisket and it shows.  Mindblowingly awesome.  The turkey was also excellent.  Not dry like most turkeys and had a gentle smoke flavor that made it light and flavorful.  The pork ribs were my second favorite meat on the tray.  Fall off the bone tender (I'm pretty sure if I shook the ribs enough, the meat would literally fall off), with a great smoke ring and gentle texture.  The pulled pork was also juicy and delicious and goes great with any of their sauces (my favorite is the mustard sauce).  The sausage was actually a surprise in that it was spicier than I expected.  I think they might've thrown some jalapeño in there or something.  But again, excellent and the smoke flavor is pronounced without being overwhelming.  Lastly there were the special of the day, the beef ribs.  I had never had beef ribs before (even when I was in Texas).  Those things are huge and have a huge hunk of meat on them.  I thought tearing into those things would be a chore, but again the meat comes off easily and the smoke char is fantastic.\n\nMy Dad and I were stuffed to the gills when all was said and done, but were both blown away with this place.  The quality of the meat is unmatched by any barbecue joint you'll find in Arizona.  The owners' passion for barbecue shows from the moment you walk in the door.  And they all came out to ask how experience went, whether there was anything they could improve, and they enthusiastically showed us the ins and outs of their custom smoker out on the patio.  \n\nGreat people, great food, great find.  Be sure to get here at opening though.  This place will only get busier (deservedly so).",

    "text": "Had my wedding here in 2010.  We got engaged in December and thought we'd do a May wedding and looked at a few places, but as soon as we saw Ashley Manor I wanted to hold it there.  It was beautiful.  When I expressed my interest to the coordinator at Ashley Manor she told me that I could get a major discount if I opted to do our wedding earlier than the wedding 'season' at the end of the Spring, like we'd originally planned.  The discount was considerable if we could do the wedding on certain weekday dates in February and we were game, so our late May wedding suddenly became our mid-February wedding.  As you can imagine we were rushing to get things done!  Thank God for the Ashley Manor coordinators, they made it 100x easier than I could have ever imagined!\n\nWe opted for an all-inclusive package which (in 2010) was almost $10,000, again we got a nice discount because we chose a less popular time.  The package included facility rental, food and drink for 50 people (LUX Catering: three appetizers,  two entrees, one salad, one vegetable, one starch), basic bar service and a bartender, a DJ and Master of Ceremonies for 5 hours, a cake for 50 (Nancy Rae Cakes), ALL of the flowers for the whole event, a security guard, and a choice of linen colors for the tables and a coordinator to make sure the whole thing went smoothly.\n\nThe good things\n\n-The place is very, very pretty, there are a couple of places here and there that could use some minor repairs and updating, but really, this place is pretty.  \n\n-Our flowers were amazing!  We ordered blue roses and white Easter lilies.  The effect was gorgeous, and they didn't spray paint the roses, but had them water dyed the exact same color of bright blue that I wanted.  I'm a florist's daughter, and I was impressed.\n\n-The cake was beautiful and DELICIOUS.  We ordered a banana cake with strawberry filling and white buttercream icing, piped in a lacy-white spiderweb overlay.  Not only did Nancy Rae not bat an eye when we told her we wanted a 'Corpse Bride' themed cake, she went above and beyond in delivering one!  We had collectors edition Corpse Bride figurines for our cake toppers and the effect was beautiful, creepy and playful. \n\n-They had no issues with us doing a candy buffet and happily provided a candy table in the castle turret opposite the cake turret.  We did an assortment of purple, black, blue and green candies and custom message fortune cookies in multi-tiered apothecary jars with blue butterflies and purple and blue dragonflies clinging to the sides, all with monogrammed, white Chinese take out boxes.  It was spectacular.\n\n-Additionally, Ashley Manor's DJ was great.  Our ceremony ending song was New Order's-Ceremony and he timed the music to our exit perfectly, and he was actually excited when we told him that our 'Mr. & Mrs. Introduction' song should be the energetic trumpet opening to Oingo Boingo's-Dead Man's Party.  Our first dance was to Blue October's-Calling You and he nailed it.  He only failed us once by using some techno re-mix of Echo & The Bunnymen's-Lips Like Sugar for the cake cutting ceremony, not the original recording.\n\n-The LUX Catering food was quite good and we enjoyed everything, and our bartender was friendly and accommodating.  (We brought in our own cases of wine).\n\nThe not so great things\n\n-The coordinators were all very friendly, but they weren't consistent.  We worked with at least 3 different coordinators over the span of about 10 weeks and it was a bit confusing not knowing who was in charge of our file that particular day and having to reexplain the last discussion with the other coordinator to them each time we had a conversation.  The one MAJOR glitch was that we believed that one of the coordinators had offered us two additional appetizers, but the next coordinator would not honor it and claimed it wasn't documented, so we had to pay out of pocket in the last couple of weeks to cover the two extra appetizers.\n  \n-We hardly got any prep time before the wedding for photos because we were coming in on the heels of another wedding, because of that we only got a few photographs of the wedding party.  That made me very sad.\n\n-Finally, at the end of the event almost NOBODY was still there from Ashley Manor staff for me to ask if there was anyone to help us clean up and pack our stuff.   I didn't know if we were supposed to leave our stuff and get it the next day, or what.  We weren't really told what to expect, and so there I was at midnight, in my gown, trying to pack up my stuff and get ready to leave.  Finally someone told us we could get it in the morning if we got there by 10 AM.  When we got there the next day, our stuff was packed up for us and ready to go, but sadly one of my apothecary jars from my candy buffet had been broken and the cake topper that we were supposed to freeze for our one year anniversary had been crammed into a too-small cake box and smooshed.   :(\n\nPics uploaded.",

    "text": "Wow!  Just wow!  Totally and utterly overrated.  I really wanted to believe the hype and hysteria.  I really did. \n\nMy best friend and I went there last week.  The menu was melon soup with lime sorbet, heirloom tomato and cheese salad, and either ribeye or curried fish.  \n\nFirst the atmosphere is fantastic, really quaint and romantic. The servers were well meaning too.  \n\nFirst course: the amuse Bouche soup. It was about two table spoons of melon smoothie that anyone with a Vitamix can make.  Oh but it had a dollop of lime sorbet on top and a colorful swirl of who cares.  It was like getting dessert as appetizer but much less satisfying.\n\nSecond course: the heirloom tomato and super sprout phenomenon salad.  \nIt had three  one quarter inch thick half moon slices of tomatos, three pieces of cheese and three quarters of a pound of sprouts of some über micro green.  But to be fair it did have a shmear of some paste on the plate.  Basically tasteless, tomatoes were less than ripe and still very hard.   Really 55.00 for three slices of tomatoe, cheese and a handful of greens? Call me crazy but the value for a a foodie for food that tastes like my kindergartner made it is just not there.  Fail number two.  \n\nThird course entree:  I had the \"ribeye\" and my friend had the curried fish.  The ribeye was unlike any ribeye I've had.  It frankly wasn't ribeye.  It was three medallions of lean beef over black lentils and drizzled with who cares wine reduction.  Again very lacking on flavor, contrast, and flavor.  But seriously folks who doesn't love a bite of top round with a deliciously bland mouthful of lentils to deaden all your taste buds?  Oh and before I forget, after we ordered my friend noted to me they didn't ask how you wanted your steak cooked.  So the next time the server came 'round we asked why and said I want it rare.  The server (who I think is in training bc he seemed to have to ask the other server everything - which is fine better sad than sorry there's a sometimes steep learning curve in fine dining) said, \"the steak is cooked medium rare the way the chef wants it.\"  Now I haven't worked with Gordon Ramsey but I bet you a million dollars that he'd ask the patron for his opinion on the matter.  That said I still really think he was in training and forgot to ask and didn't want to go back to the kitchen and get yelled at for not asking etc.  Been there myself.  Fine medium rare will do just fine - the chef said so.  \n\nMy friend's curried fish (I totally forgot what type of fish but I think it was mahi mahi) was the best dish of the night.  But it too was not that impressive.   I think I would rather hit malees for fish in curry sauce.  And again it had some lentil bland mound under the fish.  \n\nThe final course was dessert.  We ordered two Lagavulin 16s on the rocks (it took a minute because the server had to ask the lead server to talk to is about scotch options) to go with the...oh wait the dessert was so unmemorable I forgot what it was.  I literally can't remember what it was.  But I do remember being unimpressed and saying to my friend the first course soup would've been a better dessert.  \n\nLastly the bill.  The night before we ate at Mastro's In Scottsdale and had  a much much better bill to food ratio.  And I am a ravenous foodie and I understand small courses and I Know it's not a steak house.  My point here is that at the most expensive steakhouse in Scottsdale where the ribeye is 70 dollars or so and you know you are being plundered for meat you could buy at AJs and grill or put in your salamander you are still getting tastier food and more bang for your buck.  Or likewise if you went to Binkleys in cave creek your money would be So much better spent.  Food doesn't get masked and duct taped with lentils there.  And you could do 3 or 5 or 7 courses or just order off the menu AND Chef Binkley will take the time to ask if there is any special accommodations for allergies, taste profiles etc that he needs to change or modify for you.  Oh and it tastes amazing so you get your money's worth.  At cafe monarch (where the chef is king) they must be doing summer budget cuts and dialing the food down a notch as the snow birds leave and the locals get the table scraps, or maybe it was an off night, or maybe they just serve food that way I don't know but frankly it sucked.  TOTALLY AND UTTERLY OVERRATED AND UNIMPRESSIVE!  \nOh and the ice cubes for our scotch cost $2.00 each.  That's right two dollars for frozen water put into a rocks glass.  Seriously, the budget must be really out of balance.",

    "text": "***Avenue B's kitchen turns fresh and high quality ingredients into light dishes that are also flavorful, vibrant and filling; their reasonable lunch prices also make Avenue B a great option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh***\n\nAvenue B sits in a neighborhood that kind of reminded me of Silver Lake, Los Feliz or Atwater Village.  The restaurant has a simple café-like décor, but there are great touches.  I liked the use of purple as well as the hanging light fixtures--rustic but also trendy.  The restaurant has a great neighborhood restaurant feel to it.\n\nTheir lunch menu is reasonably priced and it features dishes inspired from many different cuisines.  There is a Cobb salad and a potpie as well as a Thai-like dish and a banh mi.  I went for one of their modern Asian entrees, which was black sesame crusted salmon served with a salad of seaweed, cucumber, surimi, and mushrooms.  It also came with a sauce of sweet soy and a garnish of carrot and daikon.\n\nThe salmon entrée seemed like something you would find at a run-of-the-mill Asian fusion restaurant, but it was so much better than that.  The salmon was very fresh and they got a nice crispy crust on it.  The salmon was served medium rare and it was very moist, but it still flaked very easily.  I also liked the great flavor of the black sesame as well as the sweet soy sauce.\n\nThe garnish of carrot and daikon was fresh with a light crunch while the seaweed salad was cool, refreshing and flavorful.  I liked the mix of the warm salmon with the cool salad.  It was a very light dish, but it was also a very flavorful and filling dish.\n\nIf I were going to nitpick, I would say that the entrée seemed very close (maybe too close) to the Asian ingredients and flavors that influenced it.  But when the ingredients are high quality like this (especially the salmon) and they are handled so well, it is hard to complain (5 stars).\n\nI also tried their flatbread, which was topped with cheese, grilled artichokes, prosciutto, and arugula.  This flatbread had a great crust, which is where a lot of flatbreads can go wrong.  It had a great flavor with the right amount of char; it was thin and crispy but also with a little bit of a chew.\n\nThe arugula was great--leafy, peppery and nicely dressed in a light vinaigrette (you often get dry arugula on flatbread).  The generous portion of the arugula kind of overwhelmed the small portion of prosciutto, but the prosciutto was good (not dry, meaty and with the right amount of saltiness).\n\nThe cheese was good too.  In terms of other toppings, they used the woody part of the artichoke, which wouldn't be my first choice, but it was actually a good contrast to the leafy arugula and it made the artichokes stand out in a good way (4 stars).\n\nFor dessert, I went with their blondie, which was filled with pretzel buttercream and garnished with bruleed green apple.  The bruleed green apple was great.  It was reminiscent of a candy apple but with the use of a tart green apple versus the more sweet red apple (the more traditional apple used in a candy apple).  I think the tart apple combined with the sweet crust was great.\n\nThat candy apple-like taste made from a technique you often see with crème brulee was kind of eye opening.  And when it was mixed with the sweet and chewy caramel, it became a dessert that felt very nostalgic but also sophisticated at the same time.\n\nThe pretzel buttercream was good.  You do get a little bit of a pretzel flavor with the addition of coarsely chopped pretzels though the buttercream did not have a prominent pretzel flavor.  What I liked about the buttercream though was how it was sweet and creamy without being overly sugary like a lot of buttercreams (4 stars).\n\nI also tried their housemade brown butter ice cream and it was great--great flavor, smooth, creamy, dense, and firm (without being hard) - 4 stars.\n\nService by Lauren was great.  She was personable, nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and very attentive.  The food also came out at a good pace.\n\nPrices for lunch were reasonable.  Most of the entrees were in the $12-$15 range and several of the starters were $8 and below.\n\nAvenue B is a very impressive restaurant that showcases fresh ingredients in satisfying flavor combinations.  There is also a lot of talent in the kitchen as the flatbread and salmon were both perfectly to near perfectly prepared.  All these great things plus Avenue B's reasonable lunch prices make it a great choice for a delicious upscale lunch in Pittsburgh.\n\nParking is available on the street by meter.  It is not that difficult finding a space during lunchtime.",

    "text": "This is the first time I've ever enjoyed a meal so much but given a low rating. Tavolino is the perfect example of how a single element can ruin an otherwise wonderful meal. That element was a rude owner who visibly treated his staff with disrespect and micromanaged the whole evening in an uncomfortable way.\n\nThe servers were extremely capable and there appeared to be three of them for a busy 35 seat dining room. If you ask me, the server to customer ratio was perfect without this man looming over everyone in the dining room.\n\nWe arrived and were asked by the owner if we had reservation.We told him we did and He proceeded to walk off and top up the wine of another table while waving one of the servers (who was clearly in the middle of something) over to seat us. Not the most welcoming of gestures. We sat down at a nice cozy table and began to decide on wine and dinner choices. \n\nOur servers were all very professional and extremely friendly. We ordered the grilled calamari, Eggplant Parmigiana, Gorgonzola Gnocchi, and the Osso Bucco as well as a bottle Ripasso that the server opened and decanted for us. He was nice enough to leave the bottle on the unoccupied table next to us, but mentioned that if a table came in, he would have to move it back. We appreciated his consideration, but shortly after we heard (and saw) the owner giving him shit for leaving the wine on a different table. There were many instances like this throughout the night.\n\nThey brought out some complimentary bruschetta that was nice while we sipped on our wine and the appetizers were both delicious. But I couldn't help but be irritated by this man who did nothing but point at his staff, treat them with disrespect and act like he was the most benevolent person to ever open a restaurant by lumbering around and trying to suck up to guests by performing useless tasks. Perhaps this sort of treatment and antiquated machismo is okay is rural Italy. If it is, I've never seen it, and certainly being a  business owner calls for better treatment and basic respect of the staff. Especially when the guests can plainly see all of this.\n\nAt one point, this owner came over and picked up our wine from the table beside us and plonked it carelessly on our table and wandered off, not topping up our wine or asking how anything was. It was really rude and I told our server so. The staff were excellent at managing our irritation and did everything they could to make sure that we enjoyed the food and had great service.\n\nThe Osso Bucco was good. I liked how it was served with gorgonzola polenta and rapini-- a little different than the typical risotto that normally accompanies Osso Bucco. Gnocchi was light and pillowy. Sauce could have used a little more salt, but I tend to like things salty. Overall, the food was really well done. Kudos to the chef. Apparently the 'owner' is his brother. \n\nAfter our server had come to top up our glasses with wine, the owner came over and tried to re-do the same task. We asked him not to, because we had just been topped up and wanted to drink slowly. We thanked him for coming over. He grunted and lumbered off. Everything about him was creepy and rude.\n\nLater, I saw him mutter something to our female server and slap her out of the way. She handled everything in stride, and even remarked how she liked him and that was just how he is, but I don't think there is room for this sort of treatment in any workplace. Especially not in such a small dining room where everything is quite obvious to the guests. Regardless, she was a true professional.\n\nDessert was excellent. The flourless chocolate cake was extraordinary.\n\nFive stars to the wonderful servers who did everything they could to make us happy and were all complete professionals. The owner needs have more faith in their skills and leave them to do their jobs.\n\nFive stars for the wonderful food. The chef knows his stuff and is doing great job. The menu is thoughtful and well executed.\n\nI consider bad treatment of staff to be reason enough to never return to an establishment. Especially if I have to witness it with my own eyes. Please, Mr. Owner, leave service in the hands of the professionals you hired and treat them with respect. They work hard and do a great job. I don't want to come back to your restaurant and have to spend my night off feeling bad for everyone who works for you and be annoyed by the fact that you're in the way.\n\nI sincerely hope that the servers are not required to turn in a portion of their tips to this man.\n\nWould I recommend Tavolino? No. Spend your money at a place where you can be sure the staff are respected or, make sure you come in on a night when this owner is not working and tip the staff extra. They deserve it for putting up with this guy.\n\nP.S. Some of the other five star reviews for this place seem pretty spammy, brief and are all written by people with under 6 reviews total. Could easily be fake profiles and reviewers.",

    "text": "4.5 stars!\n\nToday was my second visit, and I like this eatery!   The ambience is laid-back, despite the gorgeous marble bar counter, distinctive winery flourishes (I looked for beer taps,  but didn't see any), including cut-out kegs doubling as decorative shelves, and one flat-panel TV (this isn't a sports bar). Matt and Shawn (the latter had been the former manager of neighbor Four Peaks) are gracious as  always.  Chef Indy remembered me from my first visit, as the guest who ordered the spare ribs without the BBQ sauce and the chocolate bread pudding, which he made a chocolate ganache especially for me, because I couldn't have the regular chocolate sauce laced with corn syrup.\n\nThis afternoon's dishes all tasted terrific, and I enjoyed the textures:\n\nCalamari app- Menu says $10, and 3.5 weeks ago was half-off during happy hour.  Menu still lists the price at $10, but my receipt said $9, with $2 off during HH.  Loved the crunch!  The calamari was prepared just the way I like calamari to be, and I know Mom would love it, as well.  The accompanying garlic aioli and marinara were great, as well, with the aioli being a little saltier than I'd prefer.  My only gripe is that for $9 original price, I didn't get a lot of calamari, so I'd only order it during HH...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w#Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w\n\nTwisted Burger- $14, and comes with house fries.  Matt had told me about TR's mac 'n cheese more than three weeks ago and said that he could sub it for the fries, if I wanted.  The burger came with brie, perfectly-crisped thick bacon (!), arugula, and tomato jam, which I'd asked for on the side.  It's made with sun-dried tomatoes in a white wine and sugar reduction.  It added a definite sweetness to the burger and complemented it well, but for someone with inflammation issues, I'd skip it next time.  (Tomatoes, part of the nightshade family, is one of many inflammatory foods.)  The mac 'n cheese was DELICIOUS!  Today's preparation consisted of cheddar, parmesan, and provolone, and a little bacon.  I had to stop myself from eating too much!  Again, this dish is a little pricey for me, especially since I can't have the tomato jam...  The great quality of the mac 'n cheese kind of makes up for the price, just a little.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ#SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg#AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg\n\nDouble Chocolate Lava Cake- $8, and usually comes with vanilla ice cream, which contained corn syrup that I can't have, so  Chef Indy (sp?) offered to whip up some fresh heavy cream and granulated sugar.  He also offered to make a caramel sauce when I asked if instead of whipped cream, I could have some creme anglaise.  He wasn't sure which of the two I wanted, so he decided to give me both!  After the first bite of one lava cake, though, I knew the whipped cream and the caramel sauce were not needed.  This dessert should be called Better Than Sex, and really, what better metaphors for sex are there but volcanoes and lava, eh?  And boy, was this dark chocolate lava hot, thick, and decadent!  I'm getting excited just thinking about it!  ;)  I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of the lava oozing out... I couldn't stop eating to take other photos...  If only there weren't other people present, I'd have licked that plate clean!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw#fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw\n\nBtw, Thursday night is Ladies' Night, which means happy hour* deals ALL DAY for women.  Also, live music entertainment is held from 6p to 9p.  I enjoyed it, and so did the other women who filled up the main dining room.\n\n*Happy hour deals changed since my last visit three and a half weeks ago.  It used to feature half-off appetizers, but now it's just $2 off the apps.  There are wine specials, too, both by the glass and bottles.  If you feel like splurging, try the Sexual Chocolate by Slo Down Vines, $45.  Very good!",

    "text": "Upon entering Lamesa promptly with two friends at the reserved time of 6:00pm this past Saturday night, the hostess without contrition explained that our table was not quite ready and that we would simply have to wait.  This despite the restaurant not at all busy with the only other visible patrons being one large party seated at the back and empty tables throughout that could easily seat our party of three.  She then nonchalantly points to a small table adjacent to the restaurant's front window which had already been set for two people - all it could reasonably accommodate.  I don't suppose her intent was for the three of us to have to endure an uncomfortable and cramped game of 'musical plates'.  However, any reasonable person would have deduced the very likelihood of this taking place.\n \nI pointed and walked over to a table for four in silent protest and the hostess did not object - perhaps recognizing the implausibility of what she had in mind initially.  She proved this not to be the case however when she immediately pronounced the caveat of us finishing our meals and out the door by 7:30pm for the next reservation. Essentially, before being physically seated, marching orders were given instructing when we were no longer welcome.  I guess our dollars would simply lose their cache after that time.\n \nFinally once seated, the hostess provided only one menu and promised that she would shortly bring us a few more since they were concurrently being made downstairs in their print shop.  Not even two minutes later however, she returned to inform us that the one menu will have to be shared since their printer was broken. Now the place was less than a third full at this time, so I don't suppose she could have thought the problem through enough to simply fetch two more menus from the large party at the back who looked to have completed their orders?!?\n \nOur orders were then subsequently taken by a distracted waiter who seemed to simply not know that eye contact is vital part of effectively communicating with human beings.  Looking predominantly down on his very important ipad (it might as well have been an extension of his arm), he inquired whether any of us were familiar with Filipino cuisine. I ventured to comment that I was \"Filipino\" and reasonably understood the menu offerings so I've explained a bit of it to my two companions. The waiter's haughty and phlegmatic muttered response to this: \"No one knows everything\".\n \nThis is a total of 3 gaffes from the hostess with a possible hint of smart-ass before cocktails from the waiter. I was beginning to silently ponder how to calculate negative 15% of something.  Now, I want to emphasize that if I were to judge the wait staff in another setting on character alone, all would probably score incredibly high - salt of the earth people trying to earn an honest living. But here I am thinking service and service skills only, and so I am not at all charitable.\n \nOnto the meal itself: The restaurant features a 5 course prix-fixe meal for $30. It was delectable throughout. One of the mains was Pork adobo: pork belly that has been confit for 12 hours, fried crispy, then served with soy, vinegar and bay leaf, a smear of black garlic purée and a side of house-made chayote pickles. It was delicious and suitably decadent effused with a spicy richness inside a flawless, crunchy exterior worth savouring in and of itself.  The desserts were also a treat - particularly the Ovaltine cheesecake. The Carnation brulee evaporated milk custard exuded a subtle, creamy and velvety depth under a lightly charred and delicately sugared crust.\n\nNote to the impatient: Each serving was accompanied by nothing less than a boring, mind-numbing and unendurable expositive harangue about the intricacies of the specialty presented. For all I cared, I just wanted to eat before the food got cold. With each course, came that beautiful moment when interest and expectancy coalesce as you see your food coming only to realize that before it actually can be eaten, one must endure yet another food disquisition.  The effort would have been more effective if it was kept short and sweet and only extended for more explanation if the diner actually requested it.\n\nMany advise of the importance of first impressions and in the fickle world of dining out, this holds especially true.  Subsequent blunders and/or miscues in the dining experience will more likely go unnoticed or altogether forgiven based on the diner's immediate notion of being welcomed and attended to by a considerate wait staff.  Lamesa Filipino Kitchen, regardless of the 'laidback cool' vibe it seems to want to convey, should take considerable note of this.",

    "text": "Bite of Las Vegas this year has redeemed Las Vegas food festivals for me. We were blessed with AMAZING weather all day that cooled off in the evening...sooo unlike typical Las Vegas weather. The crew was very well organized and helpful as they really had their stuff together. The parking was relatively painless and traffic entering/leaving moved along without a hitch. Most of the food vendors are local restaurants like Hash House a GoGo, Culinary Dropout, Rainforest Cafe, The Great American Pub etc., but the great part is that they are not food trucks that are slow to deliver, these vendors were very well prepared to handle the crowd and keep the line to a minimum.... something that food truck festivals fail miserable at.\n\nLet's start with the ticket prices, which we bought prior to the event for under $20. That gave us the viewing pleasure of 8 artists on stage and access to about 40 food vendors that were priced about $5 per item. What a great deal!\n\nFood:\nNow having experienced some other \"food fest\", I was a bit soured and didn't expect much from the BLV vendors. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised, not overwhelmed though, but pleasantly surprised by the food selection and value. We started with Texas de Brazil that offered 3 choices of meats with a roll for $5...garlic sirloin which was melt-in-your-mouth good, sausage was very tasty, the bacon wrapped chicken was actually not bad at all. The roll was a bit dry but a nice addition. All the food was about $5 and portions were decent for a food festival. The Culinary Dropout offered Pretzel bites with cheese fondue with a \"happy hour 2 for 1 special\"...2 orders of pretzel bites or 1 order with a salmon bruschetta. The pretzel bites were fun and tasty to eat. My daughter tried the salmon bruschetta and liked it. We also had the Hawaiian shaved iced that was perfect to enjoy under the mild Vegas sun. 3 flavors for $5. They had it down to a system where you got your ice pretty quick with generous amount of syrup. Hash House A GoGo is one I would never go eat at again because I think their food is terrible, but they did know how to make a refreshing 3 color Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade that had everyone gawking. H & H BBQ had rib tip fries that were off the hook delicious. Generous amounts of tender BBQ rib tips atop natural cut fries...I would have loved seconds on this. The Great American Pub had lobster mac & cheese and crab fries. I don't usually like anyone else's mac & cheese other than my own but GAP had a pretty good version that we all enjoyed. Creamy cheese sauce, not overly cheesy with bright hints of green onion and crispy bread crumb topping...and it had actual pieces of lobster. I think I would go to GAP to get this again. The crab fries were ok. I don't know where they came up with crab since the white sauce didn't have any crab in it, but still a nice outdoor fest treat.\n\nThe entertainment was awesome. There were some moments when the bass was a bit too much and caused some of us to loose a filling, but the lineup was great. Lindsey Stirling was our favorite and she delivered a great show. I don't know how one dances around like her and maintains playing the violin. She's one talented gal. OAR was good too. My brother is a Daughtry fan but he wasn't on until 7:30 and the weather was getting cold so we packed up. He said he has the album on iTunes :)\n\nAll in all, this was a great event that we will look forward to again next year. Just some tips that made our experience that much better was that we came prepared with comfortable cushy folding seats ($19 at Walmart), a large frozen Smart Water bottle for each of us was plenty of hydration to last the day, a collapsible picnic shade tent (at Sears) was perfect to cool off in and the envy of everyone that walked by us. They don't allow outside coolers, but in the event you have special medication for your kids that need refrigeration, they do allow a lunchbox sized cooler to carry it in. I hope next year's weather will be as beautiful as it was that day, but also bring a light hoodie in case it gets cool.\n\nGreat job Bite of Las Vegas! This was the best Food Festival experience for us.",

    "text": "Had to rate this more severely, because it was pretty expensive. I've been privileged to try many delicious omakase in the past that this experience was just at par.\n\nManaged to get a seat by the sushi bar and watch the itamae-san at work. Found the additional $25 sashimi presentation haphazardly plated. Not sure why, but just felt it lacked heart, because by omakase standards, each piece would had been cut and placed 1 by 1 onto your plate/wood block. Also would like to mention that the small rectangular plate should had been wiped of residual soy sauce to prevent flavour contamination that may ultimately change the flavour of the next piece of nigiri. But alas, they didn't do this. \n\nThe quality of fish were quite fresh, and it was nice to know where the fish came from. The tuna from Mexico, I found out later was actually the Pacific Blue Fin Tuna, which is an endangered species due to being over-fished with its population dropping 97% since last year. While it was nice, I don't think I will ever have it again--will choose more ethically sustainable fish carrying forward.\n\nNot sure if times have changed since last year, but one must mention that there were several pieces broken pieces served--sushi chefs in Japan would find it heart-wrenching, because sushi is considered an art and the chef the artist. To serve guests flawed pieces of food means to taint one's masterpiece which isn't acceptable. \n\nFinally the big reason why I was met with disappointment was the fact I found thin piece of hair in the anago covered in the kabayaki sauce. Anyway, emailed the establishment and was told it was from their marinating brush because their chefs wear hats. Yes, while I am sure precautions may have been taken, it doesn't eliminate the fact that it may have come from another source; accidents do happen. In any event, the hair was too long to be of that sort, but I won't contest. Do check your nigiri and bring it to the staff's attention (or you'll end up kicking yourself like me for not letting them know sooner.)\n\nAll that to say, Yasu was good but nothing extraordinary. It was quite pricey, but a nice treat for special occasions--came here for our anniversary. Will we return? Maybe, just not any time soon.\n\n*ETIQUETTE* \nAlso, don't be a \"D\" and talk on your cellphone during the experience like the scrub seated next to me. It is considered very rude, and a big slap to the chef's face. If it were me, I'd kick you out. Just don't be a \"D\" :)\n\nFor more etiquette guides, I found this link very useful.\nhttps://gurunavi.com/en/japanfoodie/2015/10/sushi-etiquette-tips.html?__ngt__=TT0d7eadd40006ac1e4ae6a2O9_cZ-TGKS1ZcN01Pi4Qcx\n\n====\nMENU - September 2017\n\n$105 Omakase\n\n1.

    "text": "What kind of backasswards place still clings to a \"Cash Only\" policy?\nA.) Dive bars that can't be trusted to give you a clean glass, but can be trusted to offer a complimentary sprinkle of crabs on the toilet seat.\nB.) Wholesome off the radar entertainment, cash up front, that may also give you crabs. Sinner.\nC.) Cruddy breakfast diners trying to instill an aura of the \"greatest generation.\" Why I remember a time back before that newfangled in-ter-net contraption when I had to walk uphill both ways in waist deep snow to... Those demon harpies are trying to steal your identity! Where's my pants?!\nD.) All of the above.\n\nDing! Time's up. Pencils down. \n\nOriginal Pancake House, did you answer D? No? You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.\n\nI see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.\n\nA strict \"No Cellphones\" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.\n\nThat brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.\n\nAnd what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.\n\nNow let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!\n\nMr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?\n\nIt's clear that you have potential. However since your grade is cumulative, I'm going to have to give you a C. Tut, tut, tut, no complaining. You earned it.",

    "text": "EDIT - REPLY TO SMOKY JON - ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW\n\nHi Jon,\n\nThis is the same canned reply you leave for all of your negative reviews (yep, read them all), and it shows the same cavalier attitude as your bbq.... In reading through all of the reviews, the one thing noticed is that the vast majority of positive reviews are unable to compare to bbq eaten in the known meccas of this country, while the negative reviews have many comparisons to KC, Texas, S Carolina, etc, etc.....  you know, the people that have been around and actually do KNOW what it is they are APPRECIATING.\nKnowing that you HAVE won numerous awards in these very places, you would think that you wouldn't fall back on the review rating of those that don't know any better. No slam, I didn't know bbq from bratwurst until I started traveling either, but maybe it would be best to show WI what good bbq is, and not high-five yourself for being better than burgers and brats off the old Weber.... as my review stated, your place does have the potential to do that.\nSo, while respecting your opinion as well, I still must disagree with you, and have offered all of the actual reasons for doing so. In the end, it's your business, run it how you will - just don't point at awards for sauces you don't offer, years of experience when it's not you at the pit, and a canned reply to those of us that know bbq stating we must not know how to appreciate it..... \nAlso - my original review had everything in it regarding how to raise your food up to my, and many others, standards. Fix those issues, and I'll give it another shot. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nCaleb\n\n\nHi Caleb,\n\nThanks for your feedback, I respect your opinion but I must disagree with you. As you can see on the other reviews and by the awards we have won, our BBQ has great quality and taste. Also, we've been on the market for over 25 years, which makes us a great BBQ tradition for those who know how to appreciate it. Please contact me next time you visit us and we'll make sure our food is up to your standards.\n\nBest,\nJon Olson \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nI'm not sure why this place has 4 stars - was some of the worst bbq (with potential, will explain after I complain) that I've had. I also get that this IS Wisconsin, and bbq has a whole different meaning than in the bbq meccas around the nation, but damn....\n\nOrdered 1/2 rack w 1/2 chicken, 1/3 rack w pork shoulder sandwich, and 1/3 rack w brisket sandwich. Sides of baked beans, mashed potatoes, and mac-n-cheese. So, pretty good variety of what they offer. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- membrane not removed from ribs - trying to eat meat stuck to a huge piece of essentially dried and smoked skin as the bones are pulled apart is pretty gross. Any pitmaster or fan of bbq knows this needs to be removed prior to smoking, any other explanation boils down to plain laziness. Fully half of the meat was stuck to the membrane as it fell off the bones. And a star is lost!\n- chicken was smoked beyond merely dry - think chicken jerkey. And a star is lost!\n- both sandwiches were minced meat to the point of being indistinguishable from one another in both taste and appearance. Where are the slices of brisket and juicy chunks/shreds of pork? Not here. And a star is lost!\n- only one bbq sauce is offered standard, the only other flavor (same sauce, only spicier) has to be ordered separately and at extra cost. Sides were very small (about 2oz) and nothing extraordinary - mac-n-cheese was somehow \"flour-ey\" with overcooked noodles. Can't imagine what end piece of corn with 5 kernels I would have received had I ordered that. And a star is lost!\n\nThe \"potential\":\n\nThe taste of the ribs was not bad, the chicken as well. I think if the \"pitmaster\" was given a raise and some training, or given the boot and replaced with someone qualified to run the pit, the food could be brought to par. I also think it's not to much to ask for a wider variety of sauces - where are the sauces that all of the newspaper clippings on the walls referencing Smoky Jon's contest awards at? Quit being cheap with the sides. I like taters, more than 5 bites please!! Hook up the mac with some cheese!! I support small businesses and love bbq, give me a reason to!!\n\nThe \"good\":\n\nStaff is friendly. Most of the food had good flavor, but fell way short on the prep/handling end. Place was very clean and smelled delicious.",

    "text": "A staple of the Las Vegas community since 1976, she and her husband opening Mayflower Chinese on Paradise Road before starting a family that has come to be equally invested in the local dining scene, it is undoubtedly a strange set of circumstances that saw Chef Ming See Woo return to that same road in 2012 after working in several other restaurants and although FU Asian Kitchen may not be the first name that springs to mind when thinking of Asian Cuisine in Las Vegas a visit on Friday makes one think it should be.\n\nLocated just past the main entrance of The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, a Beatles display and Avenged Sevenfold Drum Kit nearby, it was with the first of several Prince songs playing in tribute that greetings were offered at the hostess podium and with dining partner already present a quick greeting by Woo's son (and General Manager) was exchanged before we were seated in a round booth on FU's second level, several severs checking in as the night rolled on.\n\nUsing the hotel music as a soundtrack, great choices from The Doors to Oasis to Alice in Chains playing throughout the meal, it was to a menu preselected by Chef Woo that each diner was treated and augmenting with several a la carte items plus specials over twenty items were sampled over the course of two-and-a-half-hours, some completely 'authentic' while others exemplified ideas of Asian Fusion.\n\nPairing courses with cocktails themed to the Asian Calendar, several served in crystal clear Tiki glasses with roots in classic drinks, dining began with two soups from which a \"best\" would be a matterof preference for pork or seafood and progressing to three self-selected \"Asian Tapas,\" the Miso Sea Bass recommended by Chef Lopez of 35 Steaks + Martinis every bit as good as Nobu's while the Dim Sum was as well crafted as any in the city, a Quesadilla something one might expect on an Asian menu though it was a good sign of upcoming things.\n\nShowing a trio of signatures in individual bites, the calamari a standout due to its seasoning while the tempura walnut shrimp was so delicious that another half-order was requested later on, a brief detour to a cold dish found \"drunken crab\" mildly flavored by rice wine that was present but not overwhelming, and although the Peking Duck would have benefitted by more crispy skin the flesh was robust without being too fatty while the hoisin was more nutty than many others with sweetness less pronounced.\n\nTruly going \"all-in\" with course five, a family style presentation filling the table with shrimp, lobster, beef, chicken and freshly pulled egg noodles swimming in garlic, those looking for authenticity are likely to be impressed by not only the quality but the portions of Ming See Woo's entrees and although some bits of chicken were unfortunately a bit dried out amongst all the peppers the shell-on XO Shrimp were easily the best found so far in Las Vegas while the $125 lobster was as sizable as it was succulent, the sake-butter poached flesh topping two pounds.\n\nLimited in desserts, two \"fusion\" riffs offered on the standard menu with tempura Oreos and Banana 'spring rolls' pretty much par for the course, better bites were found in Woo's stick-a-spoon-up-straight White Chocolate Bread Pudding and a Chocolate Mousse crafted by Hard Rock Pastry Chef Mickey Harden, the former buttery and indulgent while the later somehow found me taking extra bites of something featuring chocolate and citrus, moist bites of cake providing a unique contrast to the mild gelatin base.\n\n**** More expensive than the restaurants on Spring Mountain Road, but more accessible than the rarified price point of Blossom, Jasmine or Wing Lei, FU Asian Kitchen is one of those restaurants that flies under radars largely as a result of its location even though the Chef has a pedigree unlike almost any other in the city while the food ranges authentic to fusion focused while exceeding expectations in many ways.",

    "text": "Came here to try their much talked about Pho but settled on something else.  Nonetheless, this place was Pho-nomenal!\n\nLocation & Aesthetics - located on Bell Road (corner of Bell and Litchfield) between Longhorn Steakhouse and Carrabba's.\nIt might be easy to miss from Bell Road because what you see from Bell Road is the rear of some (not all) of the restaurants as their facades face south.  The sign to the restaurant is large enough from Bell Road so I'm thinking you won't miss it. \nEven if you miss it while traveling west, it's not a problem and very easy to make a U-turn on Bell as there are enough U-turn options available on the road.\nLots of parking in the rear, and the parking lot was well lit.\nThe interior of the restaurant is well-lit if you're dining in the evening as we were, and I'm guessing if you're dining in for lunch too, you won't have a problem as the restaurant is surrounded with glass windows.  There is also the option to dine alfresco at the side of the restaurant.\nNormally I would minus a point here as the restaurant was on the small side and felt cramped however the owner - Dennis did come around and happened to introduce himself to us, asked how we knew of the place and picked it (told him Yelp of course!), as well as indulged in some small talk, and did mention that he was expanding the place by taking over the space next door which will be occurring mid-December to sometime in January, and even extended a personal invitation for us to attend the grand re-openinging.\nThe place was also exceptionally clean.  The noise level was average as it was a Friday evening but wasn't overly loud that I couldn't hear anyone in my party.\nDespite the place being really busy for a Friday evening, I didn't notice anyone having to wait for seating.\n\nService/Menus - menus were provided to us as by our waitress soon as we were seated.  Very easy to read and understand.  Even our questions were answered promptly.  Our waitress took our drink orders immediately and gave us time to think about what we wanted to order.  Drinks came promptly and our waitress even saved us some money.  We came in a minute before happy hour was finished (3-6 PM).  Thankfully our waitress put in our drink and appetizer orders just in time so we ended up paying a little less (Happy Hour prices) for those items.\n\nFood/Drinks - For libations, I ordered the orange martini which was delicious and not too tart.  For appetizers, we ordered the shrimp & pork spring rolls (2 and its cut in half so you end up having 4 bites) - lettuce, bean sprouts, rice vermicelli, and mint served with a peanut sauce dip - very tasty particularly the ingredients added to the rolls like the mint and bean sprouts which served to enhance the tastiness of the shrimp and pork.  The rice vermicelli also gave the rolls a particularly nice transparent appearance.  \nFor the main course, I thought I was going to have the Pho but instead settled for the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef - which is seared cubed beef tenderloin marinated in their house special soy, and served on a sizzling skillet with onions.  When this part of the dish, came out, it was sizzling and I even had folks who were passing by asking me if I ever had this dish and commenting on how great it is, and it's the only thing they order when they're there.  By itself, the beef was tender, moist, juicy, and very flavorful.  The soy wasn't overpowering or too salty, and the onions were sautéed beautifully and not burnt at all.  They will ask you how you want the beef cooked, and for me it was medium, and it was done exactly like that!  It was also recommended by the wait staff to mix the lime and salt and pepper that comes with the dish first, then use that to dip the beef in (as an option) to enhance its flavor.  I tried it and they were correct in that it did seem to multiple the flavor(s) tenfold!\nThis dish is also served with jasmine rice which was warm, fresh, sticky (as rice should be in my opinion) and very tasty; a side salad; and a scallion broth which was hot and just the right thing to clear those sinuses (though mine wasn't in need of clearing).\n\nWell, my intentions were to come here to sample their Pho and despite that not happening, I don't have any regrets coming here at all.  \nAs promised to the owner, I will return to try their Pho!",

    "text": "Yardbird Southern Table & Bar [YST&B]. (3.6 stars).\n\n\"Yardbird: a common nickname used for Shipyard workers.\"\n\nI chuckled when I first heard the name.\n\nHow appropriate!!\n\nOur friends made reservations & we were excited to join them for a FRIED CHICKEN meal.\n\nAs our server stated upon seating us, the chicken used at YST&B is brined for 27 hours prior to frying them.\n\nI was really excited to bite into a nice, juicy, crispy chicken until we were informed by our server that YST&B's chicken isn't very crispy.\n\nAfter hearing that I sighed ever so quietly...\n\nWe decided to order the following:\n\nLewellyn's Fried Chicken. (3 stars).\n\nAs someone who loves CRISPY fried chicken. I have to say, this version was moist & juicy but not crispy.\n\nTo say I was disappointed would be an understatement!!\n\nThe skin is fried, however, it is still a bit soft & flaccid.\n\nI'm going to guess that the brining process that is used makes these chickens moist. But it doesn't allow for the skin to crisp up due to the fact that all that moisture from the brine has been soaked into the chicken skin itself.\n\nThe chicken itself was flavorful.\n\nTip: DO NOT just bite into a piece of chicken. I made that mistake & bit into a chicken bone. Owwww!! That's all I have to say...\n\nI suppose if my friends wanted to come back to eat Lewellyn's fried chicken, I would accompany them. But I can't say I would go out of my way to order this again.\n\nThe chicken comes with a honey hot sauce which is too sweet for me, but it does add some flavor & heat to the bird.\n\nShrimp & Grits. (4 stars).\n\nI enjoyed this dish. The shrimps were plump & meaty.\n\nThankfully, the shrimp were deveined & the shell was removed, thus only leaving the tail to discard.\n\nThe grits were coarse which I appreciated as I'm not a fan of creamy grits.\n\nAside from the onions, which I just moved to the side, I was impressed with this dish.\n\nThe sauce was a nice accompaniment but didn't have much of a flavor profile. I wondered why until I read the menu again. The sauce is made with chicken jus & PBR...\n\nThere is more than enough to share if u r ordering other items as well.\n\nCollard Greens. (3.5 stars).\n\nI really enjoyed these collard greens.\n\nThey weren't terribly vinegar in nature & were made fresh to order.\n\nThere was still a light crunch to them which I appreciated. I have had some bad experience with mushy collard greens so it was nice to have a dish that was made properly.\n\nThe menu said that this dish was supposed to come with cracklins but I never saw or tasted any. Shucks. That would have been a nice touch.\n\nPeach Cobbler. (3.5 stars).\n\nThere's something about eating a fresh peach cobbler that has just come out of an oven!!\n\nThe peaches come out soft & sweet.\n\nThe ice cream & tweedle were delicious.\n\nThe cold ice cream paired nicely with the warm cobbler.\n\nThe only thing I was hoping for was more of a crisp or crumble on top.\n\nThe cinnamon stick that accompanies this dessert seemed to be \"out of place\" in my opinion.\n\nWARNING: Order this dessert when ur first seated. It takes 30 minutes to make...\n\nManhattan Boulevard. (4 stars).\n\nSTRONG DRINK!!\n\nJim Beam Rye & Carpano Antica paired with the Campari ice cube was both a beautiful presentation as well as a satisfying drink.\n\nI'm not a whiskey connoisseur, but I enjoyed this drink.\n\n***\n\nService was great... in the beginning.\n\nOur server was friendly but when we finally decided to order the peach cobbler, at the end of our meal, he looked annoyed.\n\nAfter he put our order in, he left for the evening leaving us with a friendly young lady.\n\nI understand that we were told to order the cobbler at the beginning of our meal but we weren't certain whether we would be able to finish our meal & dessert.\n\nI just felt like he could've tried to contain his disdain. LOL.\n\nTo be fair, YST&B was packed, so maybe he felt like we were prolonging our stay when there were customers waiting for a table??\n\nThe company more than made up for the awkward service, but I still felt like we shouldn't have been treated that way.\n\nMy friend wasn't looking at our server when he made a facial expression, which was a good thing.\n\nIt was nice to try YST&B, but I'm still looking for that perfect fried chicken outside of Atlanta...",

    "text": "How can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love this place? I've been telling myself I'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that I keep losing. Since this shop is in the same complex as a  Gold's Gym - that's a good enough excuse to indulge in sweet treats, right?\n\nThe shop is so cute. Black and white interior and the colors come from the beautiful cakes, pastries and macarons they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a birthday cake from here. They serve hot chocolate, tea and coffee, milk, juice, soda...and alcohol (at night). Champagne, wine and beer + dessert? Can I just live here? \n\nBefore I continue, I must say that my love for macarons started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love macarons. These French cookies are my faves just like chunky chocolate chip cookies. I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get macarons in ALL their flavors. So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some Sugar. My true test for macarons is pistachio macarons but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can special order items a day before.\n\nThey have 10 macaron flavors at a time. I think 2 are seasonal flavors and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10 flavors: fig & goat cheese, Snickerdoodle, strawberries & champagne, Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake, maple-bacon, Snickers Candy bar and chocolate-covered strawberry. I got 14 macarons - I had to get an extra fig and goat cheese macaron and 2 extra Nutella macarons. I also got a fresh fruit pavlova and a green tea cheesecake. As for the macarons, here's how each ranks:\n\n5/5: fig & goat cheese, Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry\n\n4/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy bar, maple-bacon bar\n\n3/5: strawberries & champagne, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake\n\nGreen Tea Cheesecake:\nI love green tea and not a lot of places have green tea cheesecake. The crust is crunchy. The cheesecake is deliciously creamy with a good green tea flavor. It's topped with a thin sesame nougatine and a raspberry. Amazing! 5/5\n\nFresh Fruit Pavlova:\nA pavlova is a meringue topped with fruits. It's light and crisp. It's like a \"healthier\" dessert if you will. 5/5\n\nThey warned me that the birthday cake was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another flavor. Hooray for honesty! The fig & goat cheese macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since I love goat cheese. Sweet fig + tart goat cheese...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The strawberries & champagne sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the flavors were mild but really sweet. I think the strawberry flavor needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple-bacon macaron. Score! \n\nThe service is amazing here. Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the desserts I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the desserts here cost an average of $7 apiece and the macarons are $3.50-4.50 each - the macarons are HUUUUGE though (the size of your palm or about 4 macarons) and the ingredients are of quality. Hello? I don't mind paying for something good. You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in. And if you buy more than 6 macarons, you get 50cents off each additional you buy.\n\nI was smiling the whole time I was in the shop like a kid in candy store. My friend who was driving me around even said, \"see! It's that smile that makes driving here worth it\".",

I find that the west valley is seriously lacking in this type of cuisine. I think it is a great idea to bring this here, and if it was done right, it would be successful. For example, Paradise and Jasons deli are always packed. Also a Wildflower bread is on its way, and I think it will do well. \nI think Field Kitchen would have done a lot better if it was opened in its own location, and not taking out a crowd favorite of Sweet tomatoes. There are many loyal sweet tomatoes customers who are upset about the change. Try this in an empty building, don't take peoples favorite thing away. This building was not designed for their new concept and just trying to fit it in the cheapest way possible. The flow and feel of a restaurant is very important. It sets the whole foundation for the experience. The flow here is off like many reviewers have pointed out. What was a good idea, had poor execution. \nAnyways, we went to this on the opening day. I was excited but wary because of the change and the increase in prices. Again, I would have been a lot more excited if it wasnt at the expense of the normal sweet tomatoes and at a separate place. But being the food adventurer and wanting something healthy, we wanted to give it a shot. The first thing my husband noticed was the change of staff. There were a lot of hipster young kids. I am not sure where they came from, maybe somewhere in the east valley. I guess they are trying to market towards a younger edgier crowd than the traditional patrons. We went through the same spiel as the others when we sat down. It was a confusing concept but we got it. I am not a fan of confusing concepts but they dont break it for me. For example, I still love Paradise even though the different stations are a little confusing too but maybe because I was introduced to Panera first and they have a better flow. \nAnyways, my parents went first. My dad is hard of hearing, and I don't think he got it, and he got frustrated and just ended up with a bowl of chili and did not want to go back to get something else. So he was pretty hungry by the end. My mom ordered one of the gourmet salads. She was very disappointed. She ordered a chef salad, and there was barely anything on it. I think they missed half of the ingredients, and put some flaccid meat on it. It was a terrible looking sad face salad.\nNext, we went up. I wanted to try one of their gourmet salads. The salad maker was so excited that I wanted to try one because not many people were, but then I asked if soup and stuff were included and was told No. Um, what? I am paying a premium price for this salad and I can't hit the soup bar? That is messed up to me, especially since you order in the same line. So I cancelled that, and got the soup and salad bar.\nMy salad was good. I can't think of any topping I was missing. I did miss the premade salads like the asiago cesear and coleslaws. I got the the dressing spinner, and picked out a dressing. I didnt like that the dressing went all over the bowl, I had some things that I did not want dressing on. It was annoying, and I mean seriously, paying someone to do that is a waste. \nThen,  I got to the 3 soup choices. I was thoroughly disappointed that I could have soup or macaroni and cheese.  \nI also did not like that it wasn't all you can eat. Most salad bars are all you can eat. That is the appeal of having to make your own salad, so you can try different things. Jason's deli has a small salad bar, but its delicious and you can go back. What are they doing differently that Field Kitchen cant do? \nThe bread station was good. I didnt taste any difference in the butters. It seemed like a marketing trick to think you are getting gourmet butter, but there is really nothing different or special.\nWe didn't bother with the yogurt. Our experience was just lacking that we wanted to get out of there.\nIts sad. I think that it was a poor execution to try and get more money out of their customers and they took a crowd favorite out. Now we will never have a sweet tomatoes by us. \nWe have gone to the metrocenter one a few times, but not to the extent we were frequenting the Arrowhead location. \n\nWill we be back? Probably not, I will just go to Jason's Deli, Paradise, or Wildflower.",

    "text": "I give 3.5 to 4 stars for food. But for service, it is probably a 2-star or less for me. \n\nSERVICE:\n\nBeing Chinese, I know service is never the forte of an authentic Chinese restaurant. But I was still surprised at the lack of service and the total carelessness and cluelessness there. First, they don't seem to care which table orders what so the orders frequently got mixed up when I was there; the server would carry the food and wander around from table to table, asking if anyone ordered this. So I had to watch the plates whenever the server carried them out from the kitchen and stopped her to give mine to me, because the server was walking AWAY from me with my food on her tray. \n\nSecond, they started making dumplings 40 minutes after I ordered them. After the dumplings were finally ready, because they forgot who ordered it or simply did not care to check, they let it sit on the side table behind the cashier for another 15 minutes. Our dumplings were finally uncovered when the owner saw the dumplings sitting in the cashier area and started talking loudly in Chinese, \"Whose dumplings are these?\" I had to raise my hand to claim them. So we got our dumplings after we finished our meal and were about to pay the bill.\n\nThird, it was difficult to get hold of a server/owner to ask if the dish was coming out anytime soon. They rushed by your table and never made any eye contact. They don't come by your table and fill your water diligently, or check on your order. The owner was especially warm and hospitable to her acquainted clientele when I was there, but was quite indifferent to others (I guess I shouldn't be surprised how they selectively treat people... in the Chinese way).\n\nFOOD:\n\nIn terms of food, I don't have major complaints. The food was good, quite authentic, and fairly priced. But if you ask me to compare Chou's Kitchen to the street food I had growing up in China, Chou's does not come close in taste and quality.\n\nWe ordered \n\n(1) Spicy Braised Beef Combination (in Chinese, \"sliced lung by the married couple,\" a dish in chili oil, toasted peanuts, and cilantro with a mixture of beef slices and various beef parts, including stomach--it sounds gross but I dare you to try it). The best dish we got that night. To me, it was not spicy enough because it is traditionally a very hot dish from Sichuan Province. But the flavor was there and I was thrilled to see a dish Chinese restaurants in the U.S. don't normally serve, even though this is a STANDARD appetizer in almost any restaurant in China.\n\n(2) Lamb skewer. Pretty disappointed. It has the similar cumin rub as the ones I would buy from the Xinjiang Uyghur vendors on a street cart in China. But the quality of the lamb was so bad and almost inedible: it was predominantly fat and connective tissues, and the very small amount of lean meat was tough and overcooked.\n\n(3) Fried beef buns (in Chinese, \"water-fried beef buns\"). So-so. Too much dough for my liking and too little filling. Also, not juicy enough.\n\n(4) Soybean Paste Noodle (a soupless \"mix-it-yourself\" cold noodle with cubed ham, sliced cucumber, and a soybean meat sauce). It was extremely basic. The noodle was an alkaline noodle, so it was yellower and more elastic than the average soup noodles. It was a filling dish, but nothing special, and quite bland.\n\n(5) Dumplings with Pork and Napa Cabbage. Yes these are the dumplings that came grossly late so we had to box all of them. For 5 bucks they were great, much better than the ones from the frozen section at a Chinese grocery store. But they were NOT worth the 1.5+ hour wait. I would recommend this dish to people who like homemade Chinese dumplings because they are delicious, not because they are the watery relatives of potstickers. But if they don't come at the end of your meal, you should probably cancel the order.\n\nAll in all, it was a decent Chinese eatery with some management/service issues. I saw some items on the menu that I don't usually see elsewhere and they are quite good. But still, these are basic, entry-level Chinese food items that are quick to prepare and hard to mess up. I would probably come back and hope to see an improvement in the structureless service.",
